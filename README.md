Cheat sheet for Scala is available here - http://docs.scala-lang.org/cheatsheets/

ROUGH NOTES:-

1. There is no need of an explicit return statement - methods will automatically return what the last statement returns
2. Method definitions have parameter types to the right of the parameter names
3. Class definitions also have paramaters, they serve as constructors
4. Objects can be directly defined
5. IMPORTANT - Case statements are very powerful, they can work on lists, check if lists are empty, have a single element, have a head and a tail etc. These can serve as powerful tool for expressing recursion.
6. IMPORTANT - Case statements can also explore object content - but those classes have to be "CASE" classes. This can also serve as a powerful tool for recursive processes like Inorder traversal.
7. In step 5, the concat operator :: is used conjunction with pattern matching.
